A prototype app for a karate instructor to keep track of students

Update 01/26/2021:
-Added file saving/loading. Previously, there was no way for the instructor
to save the student list and access it later. Now the app saves the list upon
exiting the app, and reloads the list upon reopening.

-Properly implemented commenting on students. Previously had functionallity 
for adding comments to students, but no way to effectively do so. Now users 
can add comments when creating students, updating students, and even view the 
comments when displaying students.
